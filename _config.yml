  Hi! I'm an undergraduate student (Class of '21) at the University of California, Irvine pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Business Management. 👨🏽‍🎓

  In my past experiences, I've worked with a broad range of technologies related to software engineering (machine learning, building a search engine, web frameworks) and even extending beyond (using Figma for product design, learning FFmpeg to edit videos, and applying market research to understand if a product is viable). 💻

  When I have some spare time, I enjoy watching documentaries and reading. 📚

          A search engine built to parse and index sites hosted by UC Irvine's School of Information & Computer Science
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          - Wrote a search engine capable of handling tens of thousands of documents or Web pages, under numerous operational constraints and having a query response time under 500ms
          - Separated search index into numerous smaller pieces in order to account for and avoid excessive memory usage
          - Used Python’s Flask framework to provide an online user interface which improved the search engine’s accessibility to users who are not familiar with the command line

          During my time at UC Irvine, I took a number of courses which inspired and guided me through the fundamentals of Computer Science and it's myriad applications in our current society. Some courses I believe were the most important are:
          - **Data Structures and Algorithms:** The quintessential computer science class; the fundamentals underpinning every computing application.
          - **Boolean Algebra, Discrete Math:** Learned the logical frameworks vital to any program.
          - **Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence:** Studied the mathematics behind one of the most prominent computing fields today through project-based courses.
          - **Introduction to Databases:** The history, concepts, and design practices of relational databases
          - **Information Retrieval, Next-gen Search Systems:** How to extract or organize the vast ocean of information on the web, such as in search engines like Google
          - **Human-Computer Interaction, Software Design:** The process of designing applications for all kinds of humans
